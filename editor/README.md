# Codeform editor

The editor is a Google App Engine app. To run it, download the
[Google App Engine SDK for Go](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/go/download) and 
in a terminal, run `goapp serve`.

NOTE: This might change to the `gcloud` command soon - if you find this has happened, please
submit a PR correcting this notice.
